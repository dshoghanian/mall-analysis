# Data folder

This folder is intended for *processed* datasets and intermediate artifacts created by the notebook(s).

> Note: The raw Excel files currently live next to the analysis notebook in `notebooks/` to keep existing paths working.
If you prefer a stricter layout (e.g., `data/raw/` and `data/processed/`), move the files accordingly and update the paths in the notebook.
